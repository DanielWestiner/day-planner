# day-planner
## Description

This project was to create a work day scheduler and planner that was formatted as a simple 9 hour calendar block on a webpage.  The app was designed to run in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.  The Moment.js library was used to work with dates and times and to populate that information on the page.
